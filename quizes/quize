# 1. Create a function that will multiply two (2) values that are passed into the function as arguments.
# Your function should print out the result of the two numbers that have been multiplied.
def multiply_values(a, b):
    result = a * b
    print(result)

# 2. Create a function that will do the following calculation. Your function should take in three arguments.
# It should add the first two arguments, and then the sum of the first two should be divided by the third argument.
# Your function should then print the result.

# 3. Create an elevator function that will run specific lines of code based on the conditions provided by a user.
# If the user types in 101, the function should print out they are going to the boys latin office.
# If they type in 203, they are going to the gym, and if they type in the letter g, the lobby.
# Else, if the input doesn't match any of the values provided, tell the user that the floor doesn't exist
# and to please enter a valid floor number.

# 4. Write a simple conditional statement that uses a boolean that will print if it is daytime or nighttime.
is_daytime = True  # Set this variable based on the actual conditions.

    print("It is nighttime.")

# 5. What function would you use if you wanted to add an element/value to a list data type? 
# Explain why you would use it.
# : You would use the `append` function to add an element to the end of a list.
# It is used to extend the list by adding an item at the end.

# 6. Do some research and find the correct built-in python function that will reverse the order of the following list.
# Then print your list in reverse order.
random_number_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
random_number_list.reverse()

# 7. Do some research and find the correct built-in python function that will allow you to find the largest number
# in the following list. Then print the largest number.
random_number_list2 = [100, 230, 40, 39403, 19]
largest_number = max(random_number_list2)
print(largest_number)

# 8. A security company has hired you as an engineer to help them develop a program that will only let users into the building
# if they enter a specific password. They have given you the following information to use to build this program.
# - They want users to be able to enter a series of codes to get access.
# - They want the user to enter an initial password value which is 0001.
# - If they get this correct, they then want them to enter another value, which is 3039.
# - If this is correct, they will get access to the building.
# - If they have the wrong answer in either scenario, they will get a message saying access denied.

# 9. What does it mean to call a function? Why do we call functions.
# Answer: To call a function means to execute or run the function. We call functions to perform a specific task or set of tasks
# without having to rewrite the same code each time. Functions allow for code reuse and make the code more modular and organized.
